<h2>Snorkeling</h2>
<p id ="Snorkeling">I was fortunate enough to travel in some wonderful places. While I travelling, I love when I encounter the opportunities to do some snorkeling. I always have a bathing suit in the car during a road trip in case I encounter a nice bay to encounter some beautiful tropical fishes!</p>

<h2>Rock Collecting</h2>
    <p id ="Rock Collecting<">Not everything needs to be professional, I just love to collect them just because they look beautiful. I have 3 shelves of them at home. As a geologist I could learn a lot about them but I prefer to keep it casual!</p>

<h2>Bicycling</h2>
    <p id ="Bicycling">I do not bike as much as I should or want but during the pandemic, I was able to go many times with my 7 years old daughter on "long" bike rides along the river. I just enjoy the time shared with my family!</p>
