    <h2>Learning Activity 1: Web Architecture Review</h2>
    <p>Gather into groups of 2-3 members and answer the following questions and reflect with your classmates.</P>

    <h4>What do we mean by web application architecture?</h4>
    <p>A web application architecture is a pattern of interaction between various web application components. The type
        of web application architecture depends on how the application logic is distributed among the client and server
        sides.</p>
    <p>Web architecture is the conceptual structure of the World Wide Web. The WWW or internet is a constantly changing
        medium that enables communication between different users and the technical interaction (interoperability)
        between different systems and subsystems. The basis for this is different components and data formats, which are
        usually arranged in tiers and build on each other. Overall, they form the infrastructure of the internet, which
        is made possible by the three core components of data transmission protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPS),
        representation formats (HTML, CSS, XML), and addressing standards (URI, URL).</p>
    </br>
    <h4>Name the model and types of web architectures of your findings.</h4>
    <p>Multi_tier architecture (2 tiers,3 tiers)</br>
        Model viewwer contraoller (MVC)</br>
        Rest Architectureal Style</p>

    </br>
    <h4>Which architecture is the modern trend based on your research?</h4>
    <p>It seems that the <b>MVC</b> represetnt the modern trend! <br />
        <b>MVC</b> separates an application into three components - Model, View, and Controller. Model: Model represents
        the shape of the data. A class in C# is used to describe a model. Model objects store data retrieved from the
        database.</p>
    </br>
    <h4>What is the name and responsibility of each tier in 3-tier web architecture?</h4>

    <p><b>Presentation Tier-</b> The presentation tier is the front end layer in the 3-tier system and consists of the
        user interface. This user interface is often a graphical one accessible through a web browser or web-based
        application and which displays content and information useful to an end user. This tier is often built on web
        technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, CSS, or through other popular web development frameworks, and
        communicates with others layers through API calls.</p>
    <p><b>Application Tier-</b> The application tier contains the functional business logic which drives an
        application’s core capabilities. It’s often written in Java, .NET, C#, Python, C++, etc.</p>
    <p><b>Data Tier-</b> The data tier comprises of the database/data storage system and data access layer. Examples of
        such systems are MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, etc. Data is accessed by the
        application layer via API calls.</p>
